        <hp1> Hi! My name is Jeremy and I am a <em > <u>Board Certified </u> </em> Foodie.Food has always been an
        important party of my life. Since a very young age I was always so iterested in cooking and food shows...Chopped, MasterChef Junior, Hell's Kitchen, just to name a few. Along with cooking I love going to different restaurants of different price ranges and cultures! <strong> Do you have any recipes or restaurants you think I should try? Lmk!</strong></hp1>
